# Getting Started on Okteto with PHP

This example shows how to leverage [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) to develop a PHP Sample App directly in Kubernetes. 

Okteto is a client-side only tool that works in any Kubernetes cluster. If you need access to a Kubernetes cluster, [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com) gives you free access to sandboxes Kubernetes namespaces, compatible with any Kubernetes tool.

## Step 1: Deploy the PHP Sample App

Get a local version of the PHP Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/php-getting-started
$ cd php-getting-started
```

The `k8s.yml` file contains the raw Kubernetes manifests to deploy the PHP Sample App. Run the application by executing:

> If you don't have `kubectl` installed, follow this [guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

```console
$ kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

```console
deployment.apps "hello-world" created
service "hello-world" created
```

This is cool! You typed one command and a dev version of your application just runs ðŸ˜Ž. 

## Step 2: Start your development environment in Kubernetes

With the PHP Sample Application deployed, run the following command:

```console
$ okteto up
 âœ“  Development environment activated
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: default
    Name:      hello-world
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080
               58536 -> 22
    Reverse:   9000 <- 9000
               

Welcome to your development environment. Happy coding!
okteto>
```

The `okteto up` command starts a [Kubernetes development environment](https://okteto.com/docs/reference/development-environment/index.html), which means:

- The PHP Sample App container is updated with the docker image `okteto/php:7`. This image contains the required dev tools to build, test and run the PHP Sample App.
- A [file synchronization service](https://okteto.com/docs/reference/file-synchronization/index.html) is created to keep your changes up-to-date between your local filesystem and your application pods.
- A volume is attached to persist the Go cache and packages in your Kubernetes development environment.
- Container ports 8080 (the application) is forwarded to localhost.
- Container ports 9000 (the debugger) is reverse forwarded from the development environment to localhost.
- A remote shell is started in your Kubernetes development environment. Build, test and run your application as if you were in your local machine.

> All of this (and more) can be customized via the `okteto.yml` [manifest file](https://okteto.com/docs/reference/manifest/index.html). You can also use the file `.stignore` to [skip files from file synchronization](https://okteto.com/docs/reference/file-synchronization/index.html). This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries or git metadata.

To run the application, execute in the remote shell:

```console
okteto> php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```

```console
[Thu Dec 19 19:08:49 2019] PHP 7.4.1 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8080) started
```

Test your application by running the command below in a local shell:

```console
$ curl localhost:8080
```

```console
Hello world!
```

## Step 3: Develop directly in Kubernetes

Open the `index.php` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 2 to be *Hello world from the cluster!*. Save your changes.

```php
<?php
$message = "Hello World from the cluster!";
echo($message);
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your development environment in Kubernetes, and the PHP webserver will reload them automatically. Call your application from a local shell to validate the changes:

```console
$ curl localhost:8080
```

```console
Hello world from the cluster!
```

## Step 4: Debug directly in Kubernetes

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE. Let's take a look at how that works with [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), one of the most popular IDEs for PHP development.

If you haven't already, fire up PHP Storm and load this project there. 

Once the project is loaded, open `index.php` and set a breakpoint in line 2. Then, click on the `Start Listen PHP Debug Connections` button on the PhpStorm toolbar. 

Then call your application by running the command below from a local shell.

```console
$ curl localhost:8080
```
The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc...

Cool! Your code changes were instantly applied to Kubernetes. No commit, build or push required ðŸ˜Ž!

Once you are done debugging, press the `stop` button to detach from the request.

> The development environment we are using in this sample is configured to  automatically enable xdebug, remote debugging and to set a reverse tunnel on port 9000. This allows you to take advantage of PHPStorm's [Zero Configuration Debugging](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/zero-configuration-debugging.html) to make debugging extremely simple.

## Step 5: Cleanup

Cancel the `okteto up` command by pressing `ctrl + c` + `ctrl + d` and run the following commands to remove the resources created by this guide: 

```console
$ okteto down
```

```console
 âœ“  Development environment deactivated
```

```console
$ kubectl delete -f k8s.yml
```

```console
deployment.apps "hello-world" deleted
service "hello-world" deleted
```
